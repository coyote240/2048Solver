The Board class does not, however, contain the code necessary to manage a game such as overall score and pathing.  This must be managed elsewhere.  Currently in development, this is being done in the Game and Solver classes, though no commitment has yet been made to either.\n",

This move is made deliberately with either score or better local state or both in mind.  The second, nondeterministic change is made by the game itself.  A random cell is chosen and filled with either a \"2\" or a \"4\".  The Board class handles these changes separately.  This is another reason that the game should be managed by another class."
